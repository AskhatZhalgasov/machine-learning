## About
This repository contains personal notes (aka jupyter notebooks) regarding machine learning algorithms.
In some cases, I implemented some algorithms from scratch for better understanding

### Credits
Some reference materials while i was learning:

- [mlcourse.ai](mlcourse.ai): neat and relatively easy tutorials
- [Youtube ML series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4_hYwCyhAvZyW6qS58x4uElZgAkMVUvj) from famous MIPT. Material is presented in intuitive way.
